# DuFuzzyLogic
Fuzzy Logic Implementation

## Relocation notice!

The canonical repository for DuFuzzyLogic is [on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Duduf/DuFuzzyLogic) but we maintain [a
mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/DuFuzzyLogic/tree/master) for the
time being in order to ease the transition. Please update your links
and git remotes.

The repo on github will be left around for a time as a convenience
offered to those who haven't yet created a Codeberg account. You can
still open issues here and submit pull requests. However, be sure to
branch from `master` for your pull requests instead of this branch!
